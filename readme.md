# ACC Travel
This project is inspired by CodeCademy. It's a website for a fictional travel agency. 

## Description
The task was to create a (real or fictional) company website including content, logo, mission or brief company description, a set of images to represent the company's products, and a section describing the company's employees. 

I created a fully-fledged travel agency homepage including versions for mobile, tablet, and desktop. The design process included several steps such as a travel trend research, business model canvas creation, information architecture design, wireframing, and graphic design.
